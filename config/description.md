We thank the [GISAID Initiative](https://gisaid.org) and the [GISRS Network](http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/en/) for critical surveillance efforts and open data sharing. We gratefully acknowledge the authors, originating and submitting laboratories of sequences from the GISAID EpiFlu Database on which this research is based. An attribution table is available by clicking on "Download Data" at the bottom of the page and then clicking on "Acknowledgments" in the resulting dialog box. We would also like to gratefully acknowledge Sam Shepard, the creator of [LABEL](https://wonder.cdc.gov/amd/flu/label/), for his effort in curating and developing this tool for clade annotations. Clade annotations performed by LABEL are viewable with the "LABEL clade" colorby option in the dropdown menu. 

Genomic data from the ongoing outbreak of H5N1 in cattle in the US was shared by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as raw sequencing data to SRA in [Bioproject PRJNA1102327](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1102327). These raw sequencing data were assembled into consensus genomes by [Gangavarapu et al](https://virological.org/t/note-about-availability-of-h5n1-2-3-4-4b-consensus-sequences-from-cattle-and-other-species/967) alongside curated metadata and made available via [github.com/andersen-lab/avian-influenza/](https://github.com/andersen-lab/avian-influenza/). We thank these groups for public data sharing.
